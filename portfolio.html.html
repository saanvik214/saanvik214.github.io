		<center><h1><p style = "font-family:times;font-size:18px;"> For our 1.1.9 project, we decided to make a game that allows the user to customize a pizza. 
			It features toppings that the user can place on the pizza by typing in the topping’s letter, and clicking on the pizza. 
			The toppings we included are: green peppers “g,” pineapple “a,” pepperoni “p,” olives “o,” and onion “n.”

	<center><h1><p style = "font-family:times;font-size:18px;"> For our 1.2.5 project, we decided to make the game Tetris. 
			It features various blocks in several colors, that the user can move using the arrows keys on their laptop. 
		The up arrow also changes the orientation of the block, allowing the user to control the fall of the block. 
		We also have a leaderboard that displays the score after the game is over." </p><h1><center>

<center><h1><p style = "font-family:garamond;font-size:24px;"> Here are all my projects:</p><h1><center>
<center><h1><p style = "font-family:garamond;font-size:20px;"> 1) Make a pizza!</p><h1><center>
<center><img src="images/pizza.jpg" height="300"><center>
<center><h1><p style = "font-family:times;font-size:18px;"> For our 1.1.9 project, we decided to make a game that allows the user to customize a pizza. It features toppings that the user can place on the pizza by typing in the topping’s letter, and clicking on the pizza. The toppings we included are: green peppers “g,” pineapple “a,” pepperoni “p,” olives “o,” and onion “n.” </p><h1>
<center><h1><p style = "font-family:garamond;font-size:20px;"> 2) Tetris</p><h1><center>
<center><h1><p style = "font-family:times;font-size:18px;"> For our 1.2.5 project, we decided to make the game Tetris. It features various blocks in several colors, that the user can move using the arrow keys on their laptop. The up arrow also changes the orientation of the block, allowing the user to control the fall of the block. We also have a leaderboard that displays the score after the game is over.</p><h1>
<center><h1><p style = "font-family:garamond;font-size:20px;"> 3) Hangman</p><h1><center>	
<center><img src="images/hangman.png" height="100"><center>
<center><h1><p style = "font-family:times;font-size:18px;"> For our 1.3.1 project, we decided to recreate the game hangman. We used movement and color to make the man, and the user can play by inputting a letter as they try to guess the word. The words are selected randomly, and the game ends when the hangman is fully made. </p><h1>
<center><h1><p style = "font-family:garamond;font-size:20px;"> 4) Choose Your Own Adventure </p><h1><center>	
<h1><p style = "font-family:times;font-size:18px;"> For our Scratch project, we decided to create a "choose your own adventure" game. We used movement and sound to make the game interactive, and the user has to escape the maze to get to the end. They face monsters, intersections, poisonous gas, and potions. </p><h1>
